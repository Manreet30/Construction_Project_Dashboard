  - Tasks by Priority and Progress Group
- **Donut Chart**: Project Status Breakdown (On Track, Behind, Completed, etc.)
- **Utilization Gauges**: Budget Utilization and Task Completion %
- **Map Visualization**: Projects by Geographic Location
- **Table**: PM-wise breakdown of task allocation, overdue work, costs, budget, and performance indicators

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Project Timeline View (Task Timeline Tab)
A Gantt-style view displaying:
- Start and End Dates of Tasks

##  Project Steps

### 1.  Data Collection
- Imported datasets related to projects, costs, tasks, and team members from Excel files.

### 2.  Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicates, nulls, and inconsistent entries.
- Standardized date formats using Power Query transformations.

### 3.  Data Transformation
- Converted raw dates into readable formats (`dd-mmm-yyyy`) to prevent Power BI parsing errors.
- Extracted calculated fields such as `Year`, `Quarter`, `Weekday`, `Task Progress`, and `WeekType`.

### 4.  Data Modeling
- Created relationships between tables (Projects ‚Üî Tasks ‚Üî PMs) using unique keys.
- Built a dynamic calendar table with `CALENDARAUTO()` and custom date fields.

### 5.  Visualization
- Utilized bar charts, pie charts, gauges, maps, and matrix tables.
- Implemented conditional formatting and color themes to distinguish performance zones.

### 6.  Design & Interactivity
- Designed a professional layout with grouped KPIs and thematic colors.
- Used bookmarks and slicers for drill-down interactivity and timeline filtering.
